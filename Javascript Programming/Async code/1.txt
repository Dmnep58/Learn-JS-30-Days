// Asynchronous code



JavaScript default behaviour is --> 1. Synchronous
                                    2. Single Threaded
                

--> Execution context in JavaScript  --> execute one line of code at a time.

--> each operation waits for the last one to complete before Execution





Blocking code vs Non Blocking code
-------------------------------------

Blocking code --> block the flow of program --> read file Sync

Non Blocking code --> Does not block Execution --> Read file Sync



-->  Event loop image in images

---> task queues add the call backs to call stacks
---> promises or higher priority Queues



-------------Apis in JavaScript-------
1. fetch
        has a concept called promises which has higher priority.
